# OS-MONITOR :-
ðŸ“Œ **Overview**
This project is an *AI-Based OS Monitor*, designed to **track, analyze, and optimize system performance** in real time. It provides insights into CPU usage, memory consumption, and network activity through an interactive dashboard. The system helps users monitor resource utilization and detect potential performance bottlenecks.

ðŸ”¥ **Key Features**
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Tracks CPU usage dynamically and presents it using graphical charts.
   - Monitors memory utilization and displays trends over time.
   - Analyzes network activity, including data transfer rates.

2. **Graphical Dashboard**
   - Interactive charts to visualize system metrics.
   - Intuitive UI with cards displaying performance statistics.
   - Easy navigation with structured sections for each resource type.

3. **Resource Optimization Insights**
   - Detects high resource consumption patterns.
   - Provides alerts when CPU or memory usage crosses critical thresholds.
   - Suggests optimizations based on monitored data.

4. **User-Friendly Controls**
   - Simple UI for enabling/disabling monitoring of specific components.
   - Clickable buttons for refreshing data and checking trends.

5. **Automated Logging (Future Enhancement)**
   - Records system statistics over time for historical analysis.
   - Generates reports on resource utilization patterns.
